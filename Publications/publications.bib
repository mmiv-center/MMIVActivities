	abstract     = {Abstract Understanding the association between autonomic nervous system [ANS] function and brain morphology across the lifespan provides important insights into neurovisceral mechanisms underlying health and disease. Resting-state ANS activity, indexed by measures of heart rate [HR] and its variability [HRV] has been associated with brain morphology, particularly cortical thickness [CT]. While findings have been mixed regarding the anatomical distribution and direction of the associations, these inconsistencies may be due to sex and age differences in HR/HRV and CT. Previous studies have been limited by small sample sizes, which impede the assessment of sex differences and aging effects on the association between ANS function and CT. To overcome these limitations, 20 groups worldwide contributed data collected under similar protocols of CT assessment and HR/HRV recording to be pooled in a mega-analysis (N = 1,218 (50.5\% female), mean age 36.7 years (range: 12–87)). Findings suggest a decline in HRV as well as CT with increasing age. CT, particularly in the orbitofrontal cortex, explained additional variance in HRV, beyond the effects of aging. This pattern of results may suggest that the decline in HRV with increasing age is related to a decline in orbitofrontal CT. These effects were independent of sex and specific to HRV; with no significant association between CT and HR. Greater CT across the adult lifespan may be vital for the maintenance of healthy cardiac regulation via the ANS—or greater cardiac vagal activity as indirectly reflected in HRV may slow brain atrophy. Findings reveal an important association between CT and cardiac parasympathetic activity with implications for healthy aging and longevity that should be studied further in longitudinal research.},

	abstract     = {Background Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to induce broadly distributed cortical and subcortical volume increases, more prominently in the amygdala and the hippocampus. Structural changes after one ECT session and in the long-term have been understudied. Objective The aim of this study was to describe short-term and long-term volume changes induced in cortical and subcortical regions by ECT. Methods Structural brain data were acquired from depressed patients before and 2 h after their first ECT session, 7–14 days after the end of the ECT series and at 6 months follow up (N = 34). Healthy, age and gender matched volunteers were scanned according to the same schedule (N = 18) and patients affected by atrial fibrillation were scanned 1–2 h before and after undergoing electrical cardioversion (N = 16). Images were parcelled using FreeSurfer and estimates of cortical gray matter volume and subcortical volume changes were obtained using Quarc. Results Volume increase was observable in most of gray matter regions after 2 h from the first ECT session, with significant results in brain stem, bilateral hippocampi, right putamen and left thalamus, temporal and occipital regions in the right hemisphere. At the end of treatment series, widespread significant volume changes were observed. After six months, the right amygdala volume was still significantly increased. No significant changes were observed in the comparison groups. Conclusions Volume increases in gray matter areas can be detected 2 h after a single ECT session. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.}

	abstract     = {Multiparametric imaging in cancer has been shown to be useful for tumor detection and may also depict functional tumor characteristics relevant for clinical phenotypes. However, when confronted with datasets consisting of multiple values per voxel, traditional reading of the imaging series fails to capture complicated patterns. These patterns of potentially important imaging properties of the parameter space may be critical for the analysis, but standard approaches do not deliver sufficient details. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach that aims to enable the exploration and analysis of such multiparametric studies using an interactive visual analysis application to remedy the trade-offs between details in the value domain and in spatial resolution. This may aid in the discrimination between healthy and cancerous tissue and potentially highlight metastases that evolved from the primary tumor. We conducted an evaluation with eleven domain experts from different fields of research to confirm the utility of our approach.}

	abstract     = {User studies are often required in biomedical visualization application papers in order to provide evidence for the utility of the presented approach. An important aspect is how well depth information can be perceived, as depth encoding is important to enable an understandable representation of complex data. Unfortunately, in practice there is often little time available to perform such studies, and setting up and conducting user studies may be labor-intensive. In addition, it can be challenging to reach enough participants to support the contribution claims of the paper. In this paper, we propose a system that allows biomedical visualization researchers to quickly generate perceptual task-based user studies for novel surface visualizations, and to perform the resulting experiment via a web interface. This approach helps to reduce effort in the setup of user studies themselves, and at the same time leverages a web-based approach that can help researchers attract more participants to their study. We demonstrate our system using the specific application of depth judgment tasks to evaluate vascular surface visualizations, since there is a lot of recent interest in this area. However, the system is also generally applicable for conducting other task-based user studies in biomedical visualization.}

	abstract     = {Hippocampal enlargements are commonly reported after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). To clarify mechanisms, we examined if ECT-induced hippocampal volume change relates to dose (number of ECT sessions and electrode placement) and acts as a biomarker of clinical outcome. Longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data from 10 independent sites participating in the Global ECT-Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Collaboration (GEMRIC) were obtained for mega-analysis. Hippocampal volumes were extracted from structural magnetic resonance images, acquired before and after patients (n = 281) experiencing a major depressive episode completed an ECT treatment series using right unilateral and bilateral stimulation. Untreated nondepressed control subjects (n = 95) were scanned twice. The number of ECT sessions and electrode placement impacts the extent and laterality of hippocampal enlargement, but volume change is not positively associated with clinical outcome. The results suggest that the high efficacy of ECT is not explained by hippocampal enlargement, which alone might not serve as a viable biomarker for treatment outcome.}
