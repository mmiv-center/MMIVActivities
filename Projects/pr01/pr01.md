Recent years have seen exciting applications of machine learning in medical data analysis, from radiology and dermatology to electronic health records and drug discovery. This has led to great interest and enormous expectations from the medical profession. However, it is still early days for the evaluation and integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning-derived information in clinical practice. This proposal addresses one of the crucial missing elements required for implementation and integration in clinical radiology: an innovative, direct integration of computational imaging methods with picture archive and communication systems (PACS). To ensure the usefulness of our innovation, we will apply it to two of the most important health challenges in modern society: cancers in women (uterus) and men (prostate).

Modern machine learning algorithms integrated deep into clinical workflows can have immense impact by offering more personalized treatments and predictions of outcome for a wide variety of conditions. By producing accurate measurements, predictions and pre-processing in close to real-time, machine learning methods make it feasible to do advanced image and data-processing in the clinical setting, potentially lessening workload, empowering physicians, and reducing interobserver variability. If machine learning is able to show convincing results in the clinic this could potentially open the avenue for innovations based on other advanced computational methods that have the potential to improve our understanding and predict health and disease, facilitating a stronger clinical presence for the broader field of computational medicine, an area that holds great promise for the future of medicine.


Primary objective: construct a robust, working prototype that receive a DICOM study pushed from the PACS system, setup and run it through deep learning-based image processing methods, and format and return the resulting information, segmentation mask, derived reports, and quantitative measures back into the PACS. The system will also facilitate the evaluation and further training of the deep learning model based on feedback from
the user by storing such modifications as annotations in the PACS. The prototype workflow will be assessed by experienced radiologists from the relevant clinical domains.
Secondary objective: prove that our approach is generalizable. This objective is three-fold: the approach should generalize to other computational medical imaging methods, different medical applications, and provide a clear path to embed our product in production-level, widely used PACS and image reading systems.
