\subsection*{Current challenges in the field}

Major depression is a common and serious medical condition that may lead to profound suffering for affected individuals and families. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure, done under general anesthesia, in which electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally causing a brief seizure. Although ECT has remained the most effective acute treatment for major depressive episodes for nearly 80 years, how it works and why it is effective is not well known. Only a small proportion of patients with treatment resistant depression are offered ECT, and typically 60-80\% experience a good response (> 50\% symptom reduction). 

Several neuroimaging studies of ECT have demonstrated volume increases of brain areas after treatment. The most consistent finding has been volume increase of the hippocampus. However, a link between the treatment induced brain changes and clinical improvement has not been established. An important reason for our knowledge gap is that single studies have limited samples and lack statistical power to reach firm conclusions. The Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration was founded with a belief that collaboration and mega-analysis of combined data will lead to new knowledge that can be generalized across individual research sites.

This project explores how ECT changes the brain, and if the structural (or functional) changes that are seen can explain the effect (or side-effects) of the treatment. 

We do not understand how treatment-induced changes relate to outcome. Patients ask for evidence-based advice – prior to treatment – about their personal risk of side effects as well as the probability of good clinical response.

\subsection*{Important results}

\subsubsection{Local ECT-MRI study}
Study protocol published in 2015 (PMID: 25927716), data collection (N=40 patients and 2 control groups with N = 20) was completed in ultimo 2018. The data include multimodal imaging, clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing, blood samples. Data are being shared in GEMRIC and with other collaborators, see below for GEMRIC results. One paper on the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on serum tryptophan metabolites (PMID: 31176607) has been published in 2019 and we have promising unpublished results from analyses of neurocognitive effects, brain volume changes, radiological reading and GABA spectroscopy.

\subsubsection{Global GEMRIC study}
A consortium paper was published in 2017 (PMID: 28275543). Our first project investigated the effects of ECT induced volume change of the hippocampus was published in 2018 (PMID: 30006199). In 2019 we documented that the brain changes induced by ECT are broadly distributed in the brain and not specific for the hippocampus (PMID: 31561859), and in a separate analysis we showed that the electrical field of the stimulus is correlated to the volume change (PMID: 31644424). By the end of 2019, 20 sites have contributed data giving a current potential for ~ 911 subjects (including controls). 

\subsection*{Future plans}
\subsubsection{Local ECT-MRI study}
Publishing results from ongoing analyses. Contribute data to consortia such as the Genetics of ECT and severe Depressive Disorder international consortium (Gen-ECT-ic; PMID: 31802253). We are also planning a new local study which will adopt improved imaging protocols in accord with the GEMRIC recommendations. 

\subsubsection{Global GEMRIC study}
GEMRIC will include more sites and increase sample size to 2000 within 3 years. With more the 20 ongoing analyses – we will further document the effects of ECT on the human brain. New studies will also include resting state fMRI and diffusion weighted imaging (e.g. Diffusion Tensor Imaging). Many will use machine learning algorithms – with a goal of predicting effects and- or side effects. We will also motivate new prospective studies and develop recommendations for harmonization of such studies.
